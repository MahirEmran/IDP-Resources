# IDP Resources
Resources for Intermediate Data Programming @ North Creek High School - P1 & P3

These resources will be available to you for every homework assignment, and at any time you need. They will be in this repository as markdown (`.md`) files. There are folders separating out the files based on general topics.

It will likely be useful for review, assignments, and quiz/exam preparation. 

Here is a list of the current files available, along with a description:
- [collections.md](api/collections.md) (a 'cheatsheet' for methods on lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples)
- [pandas_df.md](api/pandas_df.md) (a guide on various methods on DataFrames in the Pandas library)
- [writing_comments.md](misc/writing_comments.md) (a guide for how to write good inline and docstring comments for your methods)
- [flake8.md](misc/flake8.md) (an explanation on the flake8 extension, and the rules turned off)

Your IDP TAs are working to get you more resources as the year extends. Some of our future plans are:
- Update and expand info on Pandas DataFrames/Series
- Info on Python classes
- API on ML libraries (like sklearn)
- Explanations on Github Repositories
- ... and more!

If you have any suggestions, feel free to let us or Mr. Rukman know.
